# CloverLeaf HIP

A HIP port of the CloverLeaf mini-app starting from the current CUDA version on UK-MAC. This port used hipify-perl to convert initially CUDA kernels. Extra work was required for CUDA specific code (references to specific warpsizes relevant to NVidia hardware etc.).

## Compiling

In most cases one needs to load the appropriate modules (including those for the accelerator in question).

Then for AMD GPUs (with the Cray compiler)

```
make clean; make COMPILER=CRAY
```

# Extra tea.in flags

Turn on HIP kernel use insert `use_cuda_kernels` in tea.in.
